        <h2>Spectral Negotiation Interface</h2>
        <p>This interface serves as a foundational apparatus for theoretical reflection, operating at the intersection of quantum entanglement and multistability. It functions as a meditation interface that facilitates switching between rational and symbolic modes of thinking.</p>
        <div class="meta-note">
            Key aspects:
            <ul>
                <li>Enables awareness of present/absent elements in theoretical thinking</li>
                <li>Most abstract yet most useful for theoretical reflection</li>
                <li>Functions as a cognitive switching mechanism</li>

        <h2>Information Architecture Navigator</h2>
