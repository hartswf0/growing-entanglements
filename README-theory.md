# Force-Behavior Topology: A Framework for Inverse Generative Social Systems

## Abstract

We present a formal framework for modeling complex social systems through force-directed behavioral graphs. The system enables real-time simulation of competing social forces through a weighted behavior network, with dynamic state updates based on spatial relationships and force interactions.

## 1. System Definition

### 1.1 Core Components

Let $S = (E, B, R)$ be a social system where:
- $E = \{e_1, ..., e_n\}$ is the set of fundamental forces
- $B = \{b_1, ..., b_m\}$ is the set of observable behaviors
- $R = \{r_1, ..., r_k\}$ is the set of force relationships

Each force $e_i$ has properties:
```
e_i = {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    color: hex,
    behaviors: B_i ⊆ B
}
```

### 1.2 Behavior Network

Each behavior $b_j$ is defined as:
```
b_j = {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    parent: e_i,
    score: [0,1],
    weight: float,
    connections: Set<b_k>
}
```

## 2. Dynamic State Evolution

### 2.1 Force Calculation

For each time step $t$, the force $F_{ij}$ between behaviors $b_i$ and $b_j$ is:

$F_{ij} = k \cdot \frac{w_i \cdot w_j}{d_{ij}^2}$

where:
- $k$ is the force constant
- $w_i, w_j$ are behavior weights
- $d_{ij}$ is the spatial distance

### 2.2 Behavior Score Updates

Behavior scores are updated according to:

$s_i(t+1) = \alpha \cdot s_i(t) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \sum_{j \in N(i)} F_{ij}$

where:
- $s_i(t)$ is the score of behavior $i$ at time $t$
- $\alpha$ is the momentum factor
- $N(i)$ is the set of neighboring behaviors

### 2.3 Force Dominance

The dominant force $e_{dom}$ at time $t$ is:

$e_{dom} = \argmax_{e_i \in E} \sum_{b_j \in B_i} s_j(t)$

## 3. Narrative Generation

### 3.1 State Representation

For each time step, the system state $\sigma_t$ is encoded as:
```
σ_t = {
    day: int,
    dominant: {
        force: e_i,
        behavior: b_j,
        intensity: [0,1]
    },
    secondary: {
        force: e_k,
        behavior: b_l,
        intensity: [0,1]
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Narrative Mapping

Let $N: \sigma_t \rightarrow \text{String}$ be the narrative mapping function:
```
N(σ_t) = template(σ_t.dominant) ⊕ content(σ_t.dominant.behavior) ⊕ 
         transition ⊕ template(σ_t.secondary) ⊕ content(σ_t.secondary.behavior)
```

## 4. Implementation Constraints

### 4.1 Force Graph Properties
- Nodes maintain minimum separation distance $d_{min}$
- Force magnitudes are capped at $F_{max}$
- Graph updates occur at fixed time intervals $\Delta t$

### 4.2 Behavioral Constraints
- $\sum_{b_i \in B} s_i(t) = 1$ (normalized scores)
- $s_i(t) \in [0,1]$ (bounded scores)
- $w_i > 0$ (positive weights)

## 5. System Evolution

The system evolves through:

1. User-initiated spatial perturbations
2. Force-directed node repositioning
3. Score propagation through behavior network
4. Narrative state generation
5. Visual state updates

This creates a feedback loop between user actions, system state, and narrative output.

## 6. Applications

This framework can be applied to any domain with:
1. Competing fundamental forces
2. Observable behaviors linked to forces
3. Spatial/temporal relationships between behaviors
4. Narrative interpretation requirements

Examples include:
- Political movement dynamics
- Cultural evolution systems
- Economic behavior models
- Social conflict simulations
